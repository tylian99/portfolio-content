      <p>Callie is a part of the Squid Sisters pop idol duo and a former host of Inkopolis News, along with her cousin Marie. Her signature color is magenta.</p>
      <p>Callie is a very fashionable Inkling and has a more 'outgoing' design in comparison to her cousin. She sports a classic twin-tail hairstyle, 
        with calf-length black tentacles and a large bow on the back of her head. The ends of her tentacles have a pink gradient and are decorated with spots.
        She parts her bangs to the left. Unlike of the usual Inkling eye mask, Callie's eye markings are more angular, with small eyelash-like points, and include a beauty mark under her left eye.
        She has large golden irises and plus-shaped brown pupils underneath large oval eyebrows. Her ears are slightly narrower, longer, and more upturned than those of the average Inkling.</p>
