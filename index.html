      <h2>Introduction to Splatoon series.</h2>
      <p>Splatoon is a third-person shooter video game franchise created by Hisashi Nogami, and developed and owned by Nintendo. Set in a post-apocalyptic Earth inhabited by anthropomorphic marine animals, the series centers around fictional cephalopods known as Inklings and Octolings - based on squids and octopuses respectively - which can transform between humanoid and cephalopod forms at will. They frequently engage in turf war battles with each other and use a variety of weapons that produce and shoot colored ink while in humanoid form, or swim and hide in surfaces covered in their own-colored ink while in their cephalopodic forms.
The first game in the series, Splatoon, was released for the Wii U in May 2015. A sequel, Splatoon 2, was released for the Nintendo Switch in July 2017, followed by an expansion pack, Octo Expansion, in June 2018. The series has received positive reviews for its style, gameplay mechanics and soundtrack, with both games in the series having been nominated and awarded several year-end accolades from various gaming publications. The series has sold over 18 million copies. A third game, Splatoon 3, was released on 9 September 2022.
Splatoon has spawned numerous collaborations with third-party companies and established its own esports tournament circuit in 2018. It has spawned a manga series as well as holographic music concerts in Japan.</p>
