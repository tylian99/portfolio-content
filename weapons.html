      <h2>Dapple Dualies</h2>
      <p>The Dapple Dualies deal enough damage to splat opponents in three hits, unlike the Splat Dualies and Dualie Squelchers which need to land four hits to splat an enemy. In the post-roll state, the weapon's firing rate is 20% faster than normal, and its accuracy is improved as well.</p>
      <h3>Appearance</h3>
      <p>The Dapple Dualies are built on two main parts, both of which are a berry red color and connected to each other via a black handle. The bottom part of each dualie houses a white and light blue toothbrush, while the top part houses the nozzle and a small metal stick. The toothbrush is held in place via a small wire that holds it to the stick.</p>
